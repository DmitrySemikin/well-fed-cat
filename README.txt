## Enconding in IntelliJ terminal ##

If using e.g. with Cyrillic, then IntelliJ by default showns
question marks. To solve it add "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" to the
`idea.exe.vmoptions` (in bin dir of IntelliJ, e.g.
`C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.1\bin`)
and to run configurations of the application.
